for the Fall semester course of 2018-2019

The Calculus course is based on the third edition of the book of 
[Knut Sydsaeter Peter Hammond Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/027368180X/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link). 
The [Course Syllabus](http://www.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/Calculus2018.pdf) contains more detailed information.
The most important part is as follows:
   * Attendance is compulsory in the classes.
   * The Office Hours is in S 208/b at Friday 9.00 am. Registration via e-mail is required not later then 10. pm of the actual day before.
   * Grading: You will receive 5-5 points at maximum for your 4 Mini quizes and 30 points for the Final exam. Thus 50 points can be collected. 20 points is the limit to not to fail.
   * Handouts compiled by the instructor are available here, after each classes.
